# calculator
This repo contains a simple F# calculator built during my FNB App Academy 2025 journey, focusing on functional programming and basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide). Developed with Visual Studio Code, it’s a learning project inspired by the academy’s coding curriculum, open for contributions.
